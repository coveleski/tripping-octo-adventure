Assassins!
=======================
This is a web application to create and manage a game of [Assassins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin_%28game%29), created using the [web2py](http://www.web2py.com/) platform and [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).

It was created for a project in Software Construction and User Interfaces (SE 319), with a focus on learning about user interfaces and user experience, as well as an exploration of Python web application frameworks.

Web2py was chosen for its ease and integration; though choices like Django or Flask might have been better suited, web2py promised us a simple package of a templating engine, Bootstrap integration, and a local test server all in one package, which was rather alluring to four students with little to no experience in the area.

Assassins! was authored by [James Honzatko](https://github.com/bejbej), Christina Kufhal, Andria Osborne, and [David Vriezen](https://github.com/coveleski).
